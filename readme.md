# The Famous Literary Group Kerouac

The Famous Literary Group is an international branch out of the Czech literary group Slavná literární skupina Kerouac founded in 2011.

The website is a publishing system that implements interface that allows independent writers who are part of the literary group to register and to publish articles or books. 

The system also implements: 
- a simple eshop using paypal gate and selling records 
- a gallery 

The web page has been recently reprogrammed and uses Laravel framework, bootstrap, jquery, animate, texy, etc. 

The original version of the system was written in NETTE and is available to view in the branch LiteraryGroupKerouac.
