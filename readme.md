# Slavná literární skupina

The Famous Literary Group (Slavná literární skupina) is a community of writers publishing under one name. The group was founded in the Czech Republic in 2011.

The website is a publishing system that implements features that allow independent writers who are part of the literary group to register and to publish articles or books. 

The system also implements: 
- a simple eshop using paypal gate and selling records 
- a gallery 

The web page has been recently reprogrammed and uses Laravel framework, bootstrap, jquery, animate, texy, etc. 

The original version of the system was written in NETTE and is available to view in the branch LiteraryGroupKerouac.
